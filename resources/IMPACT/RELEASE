#######  0.9.1  #######

* New option -short
  -short [no|pa|tjm] causes impact to only output the calculated CCSs. The argument
  determines if the raw pa value or the tjm prediction is printed. "no", which
  is the default, disables the short format, yielding full output.

* New option -format
  -format [guess|pdb|xyz] tells impact to either derive the input file format from the
  file name ("guess", default), or assume that all input files are of the specified format.

* Wildcards under Windows
  Wildcards are now expanded correctly under Windows for MinGW-w64 and MSVC builds.

* rand() fallback
  For MinGW-w64 and MSVC the rand() is now used as the RNG.


=== Compilation ===

Numerous adjustments were done under the hood of impact to facilitate compilation
and clean up the code, the most important being:

* Sequestered a number of (harmless) warnings for MSVC.
