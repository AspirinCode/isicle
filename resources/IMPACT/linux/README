IMPACT is a command-line tool and a library for efficient
calculation of collisional cross sections (CCS) from
structure models.

When using IMPACT for work aimed for publication,
please cite:

  Collision Cross Sections for Structural Proteomics.
  Structure (2015) 23, 791--799.

That paper also describes the relevant theory behind IMPACT,
including acceleration strategies, error estimates, and the
calibration to TJM.

#######  INSTALLATION  ########

Requirements:
  CMake v 2.8 or higher.

=== UNIX / Linux / Mac OS X ===

1.
Create a build directory (e.g. 'build') that
is separate from the source directory. Enter
said directory.

2.
Issue 'cmake <options> path-to-impact-sources'

Some useful options, some of which are standard
cmake options, are:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path-to-install-destination
  Sets the install directory

-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=c-compiler-of-choice
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=c++-compiler-of-choice
  Dictates what compilers to use.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release
  Release builds are the default and will produce
  a performance optimised installation. Debug builds
  are, obviously, for debugging and will produce
  debugging symbols.

-DIMPACT_STOPWATCH=1
  Activates the timing functions in IMPACT. Partial
  wall times will be reported. Total wall time will
  be slighly increased.

-DIMPACT_NO_OPENMP=1
  Turns off OpenMP support. That means no parallelism.

3.
Issue 'make'

4.
Issue 'make install'

IMPACT and parallelism
If supported by the compiler(s), OpenMP pragmas will
be used by default to make IMPACT multi-threaded and
capable of utilising several computing cores in parallel.
Apple's default compiler clang currently lacks OpenMP
support. gcc however is OpenMP-capable, as is Intel's icc,
both of which can be used in place of clang.


=== Windows ===

We are currently streamlining our Windows build to work
out of the box with Visual Studio, MinGW-w64, and cygwin.
Any input on how to improve IMPACT for Windows use is appreciated.


########  USAGE  ########

=== Command-line tool ===

Output from ./impact -h :

<<<

Impact calculates collsion cross sections from molecular
structures through the projection approximation. Syntax:
  impact [options] file(s)
File(s) must be in valid pdb or xyz format.
Multiple MODEL records supported for pdb files.
Water molecules can not be excluded from xyz files.

Options:
  -h                Display this help text.
  -v                Verbose mode from hereon.
  -o <file>         Print output to file.
  -param <file>     Read atom radii from file.
  -defparam <file>  Write default atom radii to file.
  -[no]Octree       Build octree (default: off).
  -[no]H            Take hydrogens into account (default: off).
  -[no]W            Take water molecules into account (default: off).
  -[no]Het          Take HETATM records into account when reading pdb files (default: off).
  -minProbes <n>    Minimum number of probes before accepting convergence (default 0).
  -maxProbes <n>    Maximum number of probes before giving up (default 1000000).
  -shotsPerRot <n>  Shots per rotation (default 16).
  -rProbe <f>       Probe radius (default 0).
  -convergence <f>  Relative convergence threshold (default 0.01).
  -cMode <mode>     Convergence criterion; "all" or "sem" (default "sem").
  -octMinAtoms <n>  Stop octree branching at this number of atoms (default 100).
  -octMaxDepth <n>  Never make the octree deeper than this (default INT_MAX).
  -[no]octAutoDepth Guess the optimal octree depth. Will override -Octree
                    and -octMaxDepth (default: on).
  -nRuns <n>        Number of independent runs (default 32).
  -a <f>            Power-law factor for calibration with TJM (default 0.842611).
  -b <f>            Power-law exponent for calibration with TJM (default 1.051280).
  -nThreads <n>     Number of parallel threads. Should be a divisor of nRuns. (default 1)

>>>

Default parameters will yield statistically sound results with 1% precision.
For higher accuracy, use e.g. -convergence 0.005. Note that the wall time scales
with 1/tau^2, tau being the convergence threshold. Also note that the accuracy of
both IM measurments of macromolecules and the projection approximation is on the
order of 1%.

The output lists the CCSs calculated, one per model in every input file
CCS_PA is the raw PA cross-section, and the value in parentheses is the estimated
relative statistical error. CCS_TJM* is the predicted TJM value, typically with ~<1%
error for globular proteins (see Marklund E.G. et al. for details about the calibration).
n_iter is the number of probes that were fired upon the target. Example output:

#Str nr   filename                   CCS_PA (SEM_rel)     CCS_TJM*      n_iter
CCS 1     src/tests/tst.pdb       4240.4644 ( 0.0033)    5483.4717      107520

Effective atomic collision radii are determined from the atom type. First, the atom name is
matched against special atom types (if any), and if no match is found, a generic radius are
assigned based on the element of the atom. Radii can be provided file using the
-param option. The argument to the -param option should be a file that lists elements or
atom names, and their respecive radii. The directives '[ defaults ]' and '[ special ]' indicate
that the parameters that follow are generic element radii or radii for atoms with a particular
name, respectively. Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. An example file that
provides generic radii for a range of common elements and 2.0 Å for alpha carbons can look
like this:

#         Atomtype Radius
[ defaults ]
                 H              1.2
                 C             1.91
                 N             1.91
                 O             1.91
                 P             1.91
                 S             1.91

[ special ]
                 CA            2.0

Note that for pdb files, if there is no matching special atom type for an atom, IMPACT first
inspects the element field to determine the atom. If no element field is present IMPACT tries
to derive the element from the atom name based on the following rule from the pdb specification:

  "Alignment of one-letter atom name such as C starts at column 14, while two-letter atom name
  such as FE starts at column 13.".

IMPACT makes a number of assumtions about the pdb file being correctly formatted and incorrect
formatting can lead to unexpected results.
